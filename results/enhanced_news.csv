The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

In Raleigh, North Carolina, Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland will also perform at a campaign event on election day eve. Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”.

Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone.

She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.
 “The Covid-19 public inquiry has heard time and again how much hurt the Partygate revelations caused to people across the country.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Loading... Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan.

In Raleigh, North Carolina, Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland will also perform at a campaign event on election day eve. Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

The two candidates have offered starkly different visions for the future of the nation. As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Loading... Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

22,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/03/max-verstappen-produces-wonder-drive-to-claim-f1-sao-paulo-grand-prix,2024-11-03,Max Verstappen produces wonder drive to claim F1 São Paulo Grand Prix,"When the world championship is finally decided, the moment where it was surely settled was ­appropriately with what must be considered the drive of the ­season from Max ­Verstappen. The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total.

By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

In Raleigh, North Carolina, Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland will also perform at a campaign event on election day eve. Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said. Kamala Harris quotes scripture and speaks on God’s plan for America at a church in Detroit. pic.twitter.com/ImlRkkexsJ Former president Donald Trump concluded his remarks in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, home to the largest Amish community in the country. Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Loading... Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties.

The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate.

In Raleigh, North Carolina, Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland will also perform at a campaign event on election day eve. Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”.

So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

The two candidates have offered starkly different visions for the future of the nation. As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Loading... Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

59,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/03/max-verstappen-produces-wonder-drive-to-claim-f1-sao-paulo-grand-prix,2024-11-03,Max Verstappen produces wonder drive to claim F1 São Paulo Grand Prix,"When the world championship is finally decided, the moment where it was surely settled was ­appropriately with what must be considered the drive of the ­season from Max ­Verstappen. The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance.

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.
 “The Covid-19 public inquiry has heard time and again how much hurt the Partygate revelations caused to people across the country.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total.

By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done.

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Loading... Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.
 “The Covid-19 public inquiry has heard time and again how much hurt the Partygate revelations caused to people across the country.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist. Rosoman said the highlight was crossing the finish line at Abergavenny railway station to see his daughters and wife, who “ran up and gave me a hug”.

Rosoman hopes his endeavours will inspire men to take on their own challenges. “I just wanted to promote this message of challenges, essentially,” he said. “Ultimately, it’s just about having aims, goals, but grand aims and grand goals that are bigger than yourself, that are more important than going to the pub, and it will give you that sort of purpose.”","['Bannau Brycheiniog', 'Brecon Beacons', 'Crickhowell']",sport,0.9727,3.1560762,False

The two candidates have offered starkly different visions for the future of the nation. As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Loading... Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance.

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.
 “The Covid-19 public inquiry has heard time and again how much hurt the Partygate revelations caused to people across the country.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done.

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat.

To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

In Raleigh, North Carolina, Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland will also perform at a campaign event on election day eve. Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said. Kamala Harris quotes scripture and speaks on God’s plan for America at a church in Detroit. pic.twitter.com/ImlRkkexsJ Former president Donald Trump concluded his remarks in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, home to the largest Amish community in the country. Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”.

So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total.

By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.
 “The Covid-19 public inquiry has heard time and again how much hurt the Partygate revelations caused to people across the country.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live.

Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

In Raleigh, North Carolina, Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland will also perform at a campaign event on election day eve. Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.
 “The Covid-19 public inquiry has heard time and again how much hurt the Partygate revelations caused to people across the country.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father.

Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

The two candidates have offered starkly different visions for the future of the nation. As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Loading... Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

173,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/03/max-verstappen-produces-wonder-drive-to-claim-f1-sao-paulo-grand-prix,2024-11-03,Max Verstappen produces wonder drive to claim F1 São Paulo Grand Prix,"When the world championship is finally decided, the moment where it was surely settled was ­appropriately with what must be considered the drive of the ­season from Max ­Verstappen. The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage.

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.
 “The Covid-19 public inquiry has heard time and again how much hurt the Partygate revelations caused to people across the country.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist. Rosoman said the highlight was crossing the finish line at Abergavenny railway station to see his daughters and wife, who “ran up and gave me a hug”.

Rosoman hopes his endeavours will inspire men to take on their own challenges. “I just wanted to promote this message of challenges, essentially,” he said. “Ultimately, it’s just about having aims, goals, but grand aims and grand goals that are bigger than yourself, that are more important than going to the pub, and it will give you that sort of purpose.”","['Bannau Brycheiniog', 'Brecon Beacons', 'Crickhowell']",sport,0.9727,3.1560762,False

The two candidates have offered starkly different visions for the future of the nation. As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Loading... Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

195,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/03/max-verstappen-produces-wonder-drive-to-claim-f1-sao-paulo-grand-prix,2024-11-03,Max Verstappen produces wonder drive to claim F1 São Paulo Grand Prix,"When the world championship is finally decided, the moment where it was surely settled was ­appropriately with what must be considered the drive of the ­season from Max ­Verstappen. The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

In Raleigh, North Carolina, Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland will also perform at a campaign event on election day eve. Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said. Kamala Harris quotes scripture and speaks on God’s plan for America at a church in Detroit. pic.twitter.com/ImlRkkexsJ Former president Donald Trump concluded his remarks in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, home to the largest Amish community in the country. Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible.

He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.
 “The Covid-19 public inquiry has heard time and again how much hurt the Partygate revelations caused to people across the country.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

The two candidates have offered starkly different visions for the future of the nation. As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Loading... Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases.

208,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/03/max-verstappen-produces-wonder-drive-to-claim-f1-sao-paulo-grand-prix,2024-11-03,Max Verstappen produces wonder drive to claim F1 São Paulo Grand Prix,"When the world championship is finally decided, the moment where it was surely settled was ­appropriately with what must be considered the drive of the ­season from Max ­Verstappen. The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate.

A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”.

So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat.

To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan. The visit comes as Harris campaigns around the Detroit area on Sunday, stopping by and delivering remarks at a church earlier today. A stop in East Lansing is also scheduled for later today.

In Raleigh, North Carolina, Fantasia Barrino, James Taylor, Remi Wolf, and Sugarland will also perform at a campaign event on election day eve. Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said. Kamala Harris quotes scripture and speaks on God’s plan for America at a church in Detroit. pic.twitter.com/ImlRkkexsJ Former president Donald Trump concluded his remarks in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, home to the largest Amish community in the country. Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist. Rosoman said the highlight was crossing the finish line at Abergavenny railway station to see his daughters and wife, who “ran up and gave me a hug”.

The two candidates have offered starkly different visions for the future of the nation. As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Loading... Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

245,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/03/max-verstappen-produces-wonder-drive-to-claim-f1-sao-paulo-grand-prix,2024-11-03,Max Verstappen produces wonder drive to claim F1 São Paulo Grand Prix,"When the world championship is finally decided, the moment where it was surely settled was ­appropriately with what must be considered the drive of the ­season from Max ­Verstappen. The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False

A huge clean-up is under way amid desperate conditions, with severe weather warnings still in place. The storms which caused this devastation – with roads turned into muddy rivers, thousands of homes deluged and cars swept into piles – were unprecedented. The gota fría, or “cold drop”, is a regular occurrence when cold autumnal air moves over the warm Mediterranean, causing dense clouds to form. But this rain, according to the Spanish weather service, was 10 times stronger than a normal downpour. Extreme weather in Spain, and the rest of southern Europe, is more commonly understood to mean dangerous heat, drought and wildfires. The regional government is under attack regarding the lack of sufficient warnings and there is no doubt that the severity of these floods came as a terrible shock. But in another sense, the events of the past week are part of a pattern. While the destruction is unprecedented, the analysis from climate scientists is familiar. Peer-reviewed attribution studies – which use computer models to ascertain the impact of global heating on specific events – take time to produce. But the head of the World Weather Attribution project said initial calculations suggest that rising temperatures made this week’s floods twice as likely. Another scientist, Stefano Materia, said the reduced absorbency of parched earth means droughts and floods should be viewed as two sides of the same coin. Like Hurricane Helene, which caused chaos and killed more than 220 people in the south-eastern US in September, and Storm Boris, which led to severe floods across central Europe, Spain’s deluge is proof of the havoc wreaked by climate instability. This week also brought some more hopeful news. Greenhouse gas emissions in the EU fell by 8% in 2023, taking them to 37% below 1990 levels thanks to the boom in renewables.

A huge clean-up is under way amid desperate conditions, with severe weather warnings still in place. The storms which caused this devastation – with roads turned into muddy rivers, thousands of homes deluged and cars swept into piles – were unprecedented. The gota fría, or “cold drop”, is a regular occurrence when cold autumnal air moves over the warm Mediterranean, causing dense clouds to form. But this rain, according to the Spanish weather service, was 10 times stronger than a normal downpour. Extreme weather in Spain, and the rest of southern Europe, is more commonly understood to mean dangerous heat, drought and wildfires. The regional government is under attack regarding the lack of sufficient warnings and there is no doubt that the severity of these floods came as a terrible shock. But in another sense, the events of the past week are part of a pattern. While the destruction is unprecedented, the analysis from climate scientists is familiar. Peer-reviewed attribution studies – which use computer models to ascertain the impact of global heating on specific events – take time to produce. But the head of the World Weather Attribution project said initial calculations suggest that rising temperatures made this week’s floods twice as likely. Another scientist, Stefano Materia, said the reduced absorbency of parched earth means droughts and floods should be viewed as two sides of the same coin. Like Hurricane Helene, which caused chaos and killed more than 220 people in the south-eastern US in September, and Storm Boris, which led to severe floods across central Europe, Spain’s deluge is proof of the havoc wreaked by climate instability. This week also brought some more hopeful news. Greenhouse gas emissions in the EU fell by 8% in 2023, taking them to 37% below 1990 levels thanks to the boom in renewables. But the worrying lack of progress at the UN biodiversity summit in Colombia, combined with warnings about the likely impact on global environmental negotiations of a Trump victory, mean that expectations for this month’s climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, are not high. The fact that the host country is set to expand gas production, while energy giants Shell and BP are both scaling back green investments, points towards a political climate of resurgent denial.

I used to be part of the art world but I just can’t stomach it any more. Now I’m in prison, and it suits my conscience better. Back in the 1980s, art was my life. Aged 16, I fell head over heels for painting and could imagine nothing better than spending my life working in museums. Looking back almost 40 years, I see my younger self, starstruck in Paris. I’m staring up with awe at Théodore Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa and greedily gobbling up the story of how it scandalised the art world. That sickening green cadaver that almost fell out of the frame had me weeping with admiration. Of course it shocked the critics. They hated the grisly truth: the emaciated corpse that was a direct challenge to government corruption and incompetence. This was a history painting that focused on something scandalous, current and controversial. It exposed the government nepotism and corruption that placed an incompetent captain in charge of a navy frigate that was subsequently shipwrecked. There were insufficient lifeboats, and he and his fellow officers saved themselves, abandoning the lower-class crew to death by murder, cannibalism, starvation. Géricault thrust this gruesome horror right in front of polite society’s eyes. He starkly showcased the extreme individual suffering that results from political corruption and self-centred individualism. I was bowled over by the realisation that art could be a mechanism to expose horror and greed, that it could stir up the social soup, shock, shake, prod, horrify, question and provoke change. You won’t be remotely surprised to learn that the painting was only fully appreciated after Géricault’s death. But, as my younger self worked towards building a future among masterpieces such as this, I was not even aware of another brutal and insidious tale of corruption that was unfolding unseen. Fossil-fuel companies were covering up the consequences of the deadly activities that brought them unspeakable profit at the expense of everyone else. They knew unbridled consumption of fossil fuels would cause mass death and devastation to the natural world, but forged ahead regardless while most of us carried on in ignorant bliss. Working in museums and historic houses for more than 25 years, as a curator, a collections manager, a registrar and a conservation cleaner, it was my job to care for irreplaceable precious things. Sometimes I was accompanying a glamorous be-ruffed Van Dyck to an exhibition. Maybe I was carefully packing a dirty, broken shoe telling the tale of a nameless working woman. I cleaned out gutters and drains to prevent leaks, trained staff to evacuate or protect historical objects in the event of fire or flood, scrutinised temperature and relative humidity readings, adjusted blinds to stop the slightest hint of destructive sunlight, consulted security experts on the latest anti-crime gadgets. My colleagues and I aimed always to manage the natural process of deterioration and do all in our power to slow it down so these objects could be preserved for future generations. What the hell were we thinking? What a phenomenal waste of time, while the bodies are piling up right now with suffering written all over them, just like Géricualt’s emaciated, shipwrecked corpse.

They said a string of studies suggested the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body backed by nearly 200 countries, had greatly underestimated the possibility that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation – or Amoc, a system of ocean currents that brings heat into the northern Atlantic west of Britain and Ireland – could in the next few decades reach a point at which its breakdown was inevitable. The cause? Rising greenhouse gas emissions. This is consistent with what climate computer models have forecast but there are signs the circulation is weakening more rapidly than expected. Stefan Rahmstorf, from Germany’s Potsdam Institute, told my colleague Jonathan Watts that by his estimation the risk of crossing a tipping point this century so that collapse was unavoidable had increased from less than 10% to about a 50-50 chance. If it happens, it will reshape the global climate, including cooling parts of north-western Europe so much that places such as Norway and Scotland could become unliveable while most of the planet gets hotter. It is estimated that the northern Atlantic could rise an extra half a metre in addition to sea rise caused by global heating. Tropical rainfall would shift south, likely leading to rainforests suffering destructive droughts and regions that are now relatively dry being hit with flooding rains. Humanity would survive but the impact on ecosystems, lives and livelihoods would be, in the words of the 44 scientists, “devastating and irreversible”. The trajectory of the Amoc echoes a similar story off Antarctica, where scientists have estimated the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, which also affects global weather patterns and ocean temperatures, has slowed by about 30% since the 1990s due to the melting of Antarctic glacial ice. This is also caused by – you guessed it – increasing temperatures linked to CO2 emissions. I don’t raise this to suggest addressing the climate crisis is hopeless, though climate grief is real and understandable. The global effort to limit the climate emergency is not going well but amid the gloom there are some positive trends. And there is plenty of evidence that much more can be done quickly. As the mantra goes, every action – every fraction of a degree of heating avoided – counts. I raise the warnings about the Amoc because the reality of what climate scientists are telling us is worth holding up against the energy debate in Australia, and particularly the Coalition’s nuclear power push. Too often it is completely missing from the discussion. The central point is a familiar one: there are reams of evidence that emissions need to be cut as much and as rapidly as possible. There are other considerations that need to be met – primarily, making the project politically sustainable by ensuring energy reliability, affordability and dealing with social licence concerns. But, at the risk of stating the obvious, the overriding goal, the reason for doing any of this, is to cut pollution. On this, the Coalition’s position fails spectacularly. Despite all the oxygen dedicated to talking about it, the nuclear element of the opposition’s plan won’t – can’t – be more than a speculative side issue to the main game of how the country will get electricity over the next couple of decades. The chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, Clare Savage, said in a parliamentary hearing last week it would take up to a decade to just get a nuclear regulatory framework in place. That takes us to 2035 before building even begins. The evidence from overseas is that construction of a large generator could then take twice as long again (the four nuclear plants completed in western Europe or north America this century took a minimum 18 years from announcement). Small modular reactors? They still don’t exist, commercially. But there are parts of the Coalition’s plan where Dutton and his climate change and energy shadow, Ted O’Brien, could move quickly – namely, limiting construction of large-scale renewable energy and instead burning more coal and gas. Given that this is likely to be the early focus on the ground it seems reasonable to call the Coalition’s plan what it primarily is: a proposal to expand fossil fuels. It is, of course, not the only pro-fossil fuel plan going around. The Albanese government has approved large expansions of export-focused thermal coal mines. Western Australia’s Labor government is taking the remarkable step of helping out the gas industry by no longer allowing its state Environment Protection Authority to consider climate pollution when it assesses fossil fuel developments. But federal Labor and the Coalition are not the same on these issues. Labor has introduced some domestic climate policies, most significantly to push the country towards 82% renewable energy by 2030. In nearly every case, the Coalition supports Labor’s pro-fossil fuel plans but opposes its efforts to curtail emissions. On coal, O’Brien accuses Labor of planning to force plants to shut early. As evidence, he points to an Australian Energy Market Operator “step change” scenario under which about 90% of coal plants will close by 2035. O’Brien says this differs markedly from the closure dates previously announced by coal plant owners. In reality, the coal closure dates announced by companies generally don’t mean a great deal. Australia’s coal generators are becoming less reliable as they age – 26% of capacity was offline late last week – and experts including Savage have made clear their view is that the coal fleet just cannot last until a nuclear industry would be possible. On the other, if it is possible to shut 90% of the coal fleet in a decade by accelerating renewable energy and firming support technology – as Aemo and others have suggested it is – then this is clearly good news. And a strange thing to oppose. And, for all their rhetoric, the Coalition and its backers are yet to produce compelling evidence that explains why they think Aemo is wrong.

That moral challenge is timeless. But with the climate emergency upon us, it has an unsettling new edge, and with that in mind, I’ve been preoccupied lately by the underappreciated power of solidarity. Because the chances that a child in the next century will feel gentle sunlight against her skin, or hear birdsong, or see native animals in the wild, or even live some part of the year outside of a storm shelter, will depend on the degree to which we can manifest fellow feeling for her now. To be a moral society, we need to rediscover and restore solidarity – with our Earth, and with its creatures and peoples. But solidarity is anathema to capitalism, especially the brute version that’s spread and metastasized in the past 40 years. Fellow-feeling has been trained out of us. Two generations have been raised to fight a war of all against all, rendering us competitors and consumers when we could have been citizens and allies. To face the anguish and chaos of climate breakdown, which is the miserable legacy of fossil capitalism or business-as-usual, we’ll need to skill up again and retrieve the best in ourselves. Only then do we stand a chance of not consigning our descendants to hell. I have no neat answer for how to revive solidarity. But I’m certain it won’t emerge from the pitiless dog-eat-dog mentality that got us into this crisis. Nor will it spring from those who revere convention, crave respectability and align themselves with the powerful against the weak. Moments of real human progress – from the abolition of slavery to the advent of workers’ rights and the struggle for women’s suffrage – have always sprung from empathy, vulnerability, imagination and disruption. From new concepts born in adversity. From fresh language that’s honest and calls out injustice, emboldening resistance and inspiring courage. And in deeds that are audacious, selfless and unforeseen, even shocking. This is the stuff that draws us together and bears us up as one. Such words and deeds will be dangerous to the status quo, and there will be fear and rage in them. But for solidarity to endure, these must, in the end, be expressions of love, not of vengeance. Love isn’t always gentle, though. For love makes. And it breaks. That’s the price of commitment – for communities as much as for individuals. Positive change is hard. Transformations and transitions are messy, they require sacrifice – not from the weak and oppressed, but from the powerful and prideful. Under capitalism that will feel deeply discordant, but it’s non-negotiable. Having spent so long insatiably gilding the present by looting the future, transformative change is our only hope. Naomi Klein says: “If we don’t demand radical change we are headed for a whole world of people searching for a home that no longer exists.” In other words, we will have expelled ourselves from Eden all over again. Pope Francis says that as a matter of urgency, we need to undergo “an ecological conversion”. New and unlikely threads of solidarity have been emerging for a while. You may not know about them, but across generations, religions, races, classes and time zones, new alliances are forming every day. The Pope’s “ecological conversion” is afoot. Thirty years and several popes ago, Thomas Berry was busy laying some of the conceptual groundwork for it. A priest of the Passionist order, Berry described our dependency on fossil fuels as a global addiction. Addiction is a form of captivity and degradation. Getting off the gear is hard, and recovery is messy, but the allies you find on the way are deeply surprising. And they’re life-changing. But before you hit rock bottom as an addict, you’re in the grip of denial. There are so many lies you tell yourself and others. And, of course, while you suffer, there’s always someone profiting from your illness. When you suspect someone has overdosed on an opiate, you find yourself walking them around while you wait for the ambulance. You shout at them, shake them, plead with them to stay awake, to stay with you. Now, think of all the scientific and activist voices who have been pleading with us over recent years to stay conscious. They’ve done everything in their power to save us from sinking back into our deadly cultural and political stupor. Their efforts have been selfless and heroic. And yet we’ve scorned them. At best, we patronise them. The American poet Christian Wiman writes that “to attend is to atone”. Think about that. Because right now, legions of young people are divesting themselves of our sad and lonely captivity to business as usual. And they’re getting organised, networking, skilling up, raising their voices and literally placing their bodies in the path of those who profit from our addiction. Politicians castigate them. The media vilifies them. Yes, these young patriots can be awkward to contend with. They feel so vexatious and countercultural. All their banners and slogans. Their blockades slowing our commute. All those difficult questions they ask at shareholder meetings. And of course, the mortifying street theatre they insist on inflicting upon us. But what else can they do? Many of them can’t even vote yet. They’re trying what they can, snatching whatever fleeting opportunity is available to them in a polity that shuts them out at every point – financially, politically, culturally. But their voices are prophetic. Prophets speak truth to power – and we know what happens to prophets. To the mighty and comfortable, the truth is a threat. It must be intimidated, arrested, beaten, shot and, yes, crucified to produce the silence required to maintain business as usual. Prophets try to shake their communities awake. And that’s all these kids are trying to do. Yes, they’re right up in our faces, blocking our path, begging us not to sink back into cosy oblivion. Because they know what our junkie habit is doing to creation, to our home and to their future. If things don’t change – and fast – they will be damned for our sins. And their sense of forsakenness is being ignored. But it’s worse than that. Because now they’re being persecuted on our watch, in our name and on our dime. By and large, we turn our heads and walk on by. Even those of us steeped in religious teachings urging us to defend the weak, the oppressed and the outcast. We’re lucky to have young people of conscience and courage. And I suspect that deep down, we know they’re right. We’re just too proud to admit that we’re hooked, in thrall to the pushers and dealers, the drillers and their shills. And few of us are as deeply ensnared as our elected representatives. That’s not a tragedy – it’s a scandal. But instead of owning our shame and frustration, and the rage we feel against those who make super profits from our misery, we project everything on to those trying to save us from ourselves. I believe we have the collective juice to break free of what oppresses us. But we’ll need to do this together in new and unlikely alliances. That work is under way, despite the efforts of the big polluters. But finishing the job will require us to shed some rusted-on beliefs about what and who we value, about how we run our economy and who it’s meant to benefit. Some unholy shibboleths need to be overturned. French theologian Jacques Ellul said: “Belief is reassuring. People who live in the world of belief feel safe. On the contrary, faith is forever placing us on the razor’s edge.” With less than a decade in which to forestall the very worst of climate breakdown, that’s where we are right now. The razor’s edge is the terrain all morally serious humans must traverse in order to know themselves. Because the rim of oblivion is also the brink of opportunity and potential.

That moral challenge is timeless. But with the climate emergency upon us, it has an unsettling new edge, and with that in mind, I’ve been preoccupied lately by the underappreciated power of solidarity. Because the chances that a child in the next century will feel gentle sunlight against her skin, or hear birdsong, or see native animals in the wild, or even live some part of the year outside of a storm shelter, will depend on the degree to which we can manifest fellow feeling for her now. To be a moral society, we need to rediscover and restore solidarity – with our Earth, and with its creatures and peoples. But solidarity is anathema to capitalism, especially the brute version that’s spread and metastasized in the past 40 years. Fellow-feeling has been trained out of us. Two generations have been raised to fight a war of all against all, rendering us competitors and consumers when we could have been citizens and allies. To face the anguish and chaos of climate breakdown, which is the miserable legacy of fossil capitalism or business-as-usual, we’ll need to skill up again and retrieve the best in ourselves. Only then do we stand a chance of not consigning our descendants to hell. I have no neat answer for how to revive solidarity. But I’m certain it won’t emerge from the pitiless dog-eat-dog mentality that got us into this crisis. Nor will it spring from those who revere convention, crave respectability and align themselves with the powerful against the weak. Moments of real human progress – from the abolition of slavery to the advent of workers’ rights and the struggle for women’s suffrage – have always sprung from empathy, vulnerability, imagination and disruption. From new concepts born in adversity. From fresh language that’s honest and calls out injustice, emboldening resistance and inspiring courage. And in deeds that are audacious, selfless and unforeseen, even shocking. This is the stuff that draws us together and bears us up as one. Such words and deeds will be dangerous to the status quo, and there will be fear and rage in them. But for solidarity to endure, these must, in the end, be expressions of love, not of vengeance. Love isn’t always gentle, though. For love makes. And it breaks. That’s the price of commitment – for communities as much as for individuals. Positive change is hard. Transformations and transitions are messy, they require sacrifice – not from the weak and oppressed, but from the powerful and prideful. Under capitalism that will feel deeply discordant, but it’s non-negotiable. Having spent so long insatiably gilding the present by looting the future, transformative change is our only hope.

The tyranny of our distance has always meant it’s been hard to get the attention of the east coast. For West Australians, this has famously led to a secessionist streak that re-emerged spectacularly during the start of the pandemic, when we were truly cut off. Even now, on a regular basis, WA becomes severed from the rest of Australia when fire or flood cuts the tenuous road and rail links connecting us across the Nullarbor. But most of Australia has been asleep at the wheel while WA has taken control of environmental policies, driving the political conversation ahead of overlapping WA and federal elections. And not in a good direction. In recent months, it has become clear that federal Labor’s flagship national nature laws reforms have become stuck in limbo. Last month, the West Australian newspaper – owned by a company with substantial mining and gas interests – ran a front page that labelled the Albanese government “an enemy of the state”. Just hours later, nature positive legislation was pulled from the Senate, and hasn’t returned. This came after the premier, Roger Cook, bragged about giving the prime minister the hard word while flanked by leading resources CEOs; he then dispatched WA’s environment minister to Canberra to follow up the lobbying. WA is already the only state in the country where emissions continue to increase, but it’s also the only state with no targets to reduce them or replace them with renewable energy. The WA government has also indefinitely deferred their flagship climate legislation, which was an election commitment in 2021 but seems unlikely to pass before the next election in 2025. WA Labor is taking a bet that WA voters won’t care and that the rest of the country won’t notice. I don’t think the current premier is right about the first part. An overwhelming majority of West Australians want stronger nature laws and say they’re concerned about climate change. But Australia still hasn’t realised the damage that WA political and business leaders are doing. On Tuesday, the WA environment minister, Reece Whitby, stood up in parliament and, without any notice, consultation or debate, announced that the WA government was changing its policy around major projects and would no longer seek to regulate their greenhouse gas emissions. This overthrows decades of consensus that the state government has a role to play in mitigating the climate impacts of big-emitting projects. Whitby cited the federal safeguard mechanism as rendering state-based conditions redundant, but the safeguard mechanism by itself is too weak to even return WA’s soaring emissions to their 2005 baseline by 2030. Just two days later the state government doubled down by passing sweeping reforms to WA’s Environmental Protection Authority itself, following a snap review that failed to consult with any environmental groups. The government described the changes as an attempt to “slash green tape” by fast-tracking project approvals and allowing the EPA board to be filled with industry representatives and giving the government explicit power to direct the EPA’s priorities. Retiring WA Labor MP, Chris Tallentire, described these reforms as “an industry wish-list.” And in the midst of all this, WA Labor also appointed a new chair of the hamstrung EPA – a former consultant who has stated, as an EPA board member, that “my job is to actually help [projects] through the process as quickly as possible”. These changes to WA’s nature watchdog is in the context of pending approvals for large parts of the biggest fossil fuel project in Australia – Woodside’s Burrup Hub, which they are seeking to expand until 2070. In August, the EPA warned Woodside that its Browse gas proposal was “unacceptable” due to multiple serious environmental risks. Since then, the WA government has launched an ongoing assault on any protections against the impacts of the WA gas industry on our nature and climate. It is dangerous for the country and dangerous for the world, and it needs to be called out.

Yet such disasters are now dispiritingly predictable. In their wake, pundits have asked whether and how the storms – which happened to hit some key swing states – could impact a presidential election shaping up to be decided by razor-thin margins. There’s practical concerns, like whether some affected voters will physically be able to cast their ballots. And then there’s a political question: Will the fact that the climate crisis, which is exacerbated these hurricanes, raise the importance of that issue? Or will that be counterbalanced by those who have become convinced the government engineered these disasters to suppress electoral power? Believe it or not, the answer could rest on the shoulders of your local weather reporter. Such an unlikely hero went viral earlier this month when John Morales, a venerable meteorologist in Miami, became visibly emotional on air during one of his reports on Milton. His voice choking, he offered an ominous assessment of the hurricane’s strength: “This is just horrific.” That sincerity and urgency garnered the clip nearly 2m views. The resonance of Morales’s appearance proves that combining deep expertise, hard-earned credibility and a willingness to be vulnerable could provide a roadmap – or a forecast – for climate reporting to remain relevant and impactful despite the headwinds. Climate change presents the classic political conundrum of a (literally) glacial catastrophe demanding swift action. To avert the worst effects, the investments required – from clean energy to flood-proof infrastructure – would total in the trillions, but voters tend to be wary of making such outlays until the worst has already happened. Polling bears out this “short-termism.” Americans have gone from climate skeptics to climate curious, with 54% saying they consider it a major threat. And yet when it comes time to rank their top issues heading into election day, the public demurs, placing climate change second to last on their list of priorities. Of course, the repeat champion remains the economy – never mind that with smart policies, combating the climate crisis could be a lifesaver and a job creator. Despite the popular narrative, global heating does have short-term consequences, namely extreme weather events like Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Over the past three decades, extreme weather has caused $48bn in crop damage, $339bn in property damage and killed nearly 14,000 people. And the intensity of that damage has been exacerbated by rising temperatures. Amid these catastrophes, reeling residents turn to local news broadcasts for live updates, with ratings sometimes spiking by 80% during hurricanes. In such moments, meteorologists are perfectly positioned to help viewers connect short-term extreme weather with long-term climate change – having forged a deep connection with a wide audience all year round. Republicans and Democrats alike rank the Weather Channel as their most trusted news source. And meteorologists remain among the most trusted sources regarding global heating in communities nationwide, even though trust in the media generally continues to plummet. To be sure, weathercasters haven’t been completely unscathed by today’s hyper-fragmented, ultra-polarized media landscape; they, along with Fema workers, have had to endure harassment and death threats directly tied to inflammatory disinformation. But such encounters, while serious, remain exceptional. Local meteorologists are still the most effective and credible mass communicators we have – better positioned than almost anyone to persuade on climate, if armed with the right message. Enter Climate Central, a nonprofit which creates weekly climate content for meteorologists and weather reporters tailored to their specific communities. The organization empowers local journalists to make climate change personal, equipping partners in 95% of American media markets with the science, big data and targeted graphics they need to help audiences understand what’s happening in their own backyards – and, critically, what can be done about it. Covering Climate Now has taken this approach globally. Co-founded by the Nation, the Guardian and the Columbia Journalism Review, CCN provides local journalists worldwide with climate reporting resources, from training to targeted investigations of issues like extreme drought or big oil. The journalists they support have a collective audience of 2 billion people in 60 countries. But the basic strategy remains the same no matter the continent, as described in a recent column in the Nation by CCN co-founder Mark Hertsgaard: “Weathercasters talk their viewers through scary times by calmly providing practical, life-saving information.” If you want proof of its efficacy, look no further than John Morales, a longtime CCN colleague. These efforts bring the media closer to treating climate change like it does every other issue, providing macro context for micro events in the simplest terms possible. The Dow Jones industrial average offers readers a digestible daily snapshot of the American stock market. Its ticker tape runs endlessly on CNBC and in Times Square. Why not cover extreme weather with the same unswerving attention? At the very least, why not dedicate 30 seconds of every evening newscast to the latest movement on the US climate extremes index? If we want to curb climate change’s effect on our planet, it might just start with weather reporters bringing the issue down to earth. Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor and publisher of The Nation.

But the basic strategy remains the same no matter the continent, as described in a recent column in the Nation by CCN co-founder Mark Hertsgaard: “Weathercasters talk their viewers through scary times by calmly providing practical, life-saving information.” If you want proof of its efficacy, look no further than John Morales, a longtime CCN colleague. These efforts bring the media closer to treating climate change like it does every other issue, providing macro context for micro events in the simplest terms possible. The Dow Jones industrial average offers readers a digestible daily snapshot of the American stock market. Its ticker tape runs endlessly on CNBC and in Times Square. Why not cover extreme weather with the same unswerving attention? At the very least, why not dedicate 30 seconds of every evening newscast to the latest movement on the US climate extremes index? If we want to curb climate change’s effect on our planet, it might just start with weather reporters bringing the issue down to earth. Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor and publisher of The Nation.

From the rich soil that nurtures our food and stores our carbon, to the green spaces that improve our mental health, biodiversity is an unsung hero upon which our societies and economies thrive. Despite the clear benefits of – and moral arguments for – protecting nature, human activities are accelerating biodiversity loss at unprecedented rates. We are destroying habitats, overexploiting natural resources and introducing invasive species, which put plant and animal species at risk of extinction. Human-induced climate change is intensifying biodiversity loss and altering ecosystems, reducing their ability to provide natural climate solutions. Right now, in South America, devastating drought and fires – exacerbated by climate change – are destroying millions of acres of forest habitats. Here in the UK, we are one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. If biodiversity loss continues, we will see increased risks to food production, more severe flooding, and weakened natural defences against the further impacts of climate change. All of this could eventually significantly impact GDP. The world’s foremost scientific authority on nature – the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) – clearly stated in its last global assessment report that conservation and sustainable use of nature can only be achieved through transformative societal change. It will require all of us to act. This can be difficult, as our lives often appear disconnected from the natural world as a result of our ever-increasing urban and online lifestyles. Science has a crucial role to play in supporting this social transformation, by helping us understand, monitor and communicate the importance and value of biodiversity. We have only begun to scratch the surface of our natural world – scientists estimate that 86% of organisms living on Earth remain unstudied. We need to harness the range of emerging technologies and scientific techniques to track new species, understand their habitats and monitor how they are changing over time. For example, high-resolution satellite imagery is improving the monitoring of penguin colonies in Antarctica, artificial intelligence can identify and track endangered species to combat wildlife poaching, and drones can be deployed to detect forest wildfires earlier. Scientific collaboration is essential to understanding how we are affecting the natural world. When I travelled to Madagascar earlier this year, I saw first-hand the challenge of balancing biodiversity preservation with economic development. Madagascar is home to 5% of the world’s species – 90% of which are found nowhere else – but it has lost 25% of its forests between 2001 and 2021, mainly due to agriculture. Even so, the country has made great efforts to preserve its extraordinary biodiversity with very limited resources. The science community in the UK, including the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, which has a research centre in Madagascar, play an important role in supporting the work of Malagasy scientists. The local scientists at Kew’s Madagascar Conservation Centre are documenting and protecting the country’s unique plants, like its endangered orchids, as well as supporting cultivation of diverse indigenous crops that can help increase food security. Some conservation science issues are tricky to navigate, but important to tackle. For instance, the natural world contains a wealth of valuable genetic data. The scientific capability to decode and digitally archive this data – known as digital sequence information (DSI) – is considered vital to biodiversity research. When a fungal disease attacked ash trees across Europe, reaching the UK in 2012, open access to DSI enabled scientists to crowdsource genetic data on ash trees that were resistant to the disease. It is important we harness science as much as possible, but we must do so in a way that shares the benefits fairly, including to those regions richest in biodiversity. It is a priority for the UK to ensure that the benefits derived from scientific technologies like DSI flow back to the biodiverse places needing protection and restoration. And for scientific evidence to be useful, we must do science in partnership with people. We need to combine it with local knowledge and insight – many communities whose livelihoods depend on nature already know a lot about how to protect it. The Flow Country, in northern Scotland, is an example of a site here in the UK that focuses on restoring one of the world’s largest blanket bogs in partnership with the local community. Plans to revitalise the landscape have been collectively developed to ensure they benefit local people – the crofters, farmers, landowners, businesses and residents in the area. These collaborative efforts highlight the importance of integrating scientific research with local expertise to protect and restore biodiversity. As countries come together in Colombia this month at the 16th meeting of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), I urge nations to ensure science is at the heart of their commitments and, to collaborate with one another and local stakeholders to protect our planet.

Yet fixes already exist There are so many ways to fiddle while Rome burns, or as this season’s weather would have it, gets torn apart by hurricanes and tornadoes and also goes underwater – and, in other places, burns. One particularly pernicious way comes from the men in love with big tech, who are forever insisting that we need some amazing new technology to solve our problems, be it geoengineering, carbon sequestration or fusion – but wait, it gets worse. At an artificial intelligence conference in Washington DC, the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently claimed that “[w]e’re not going to hit the climate goals anyway because we’re not organized to do it” and that we should just plunge ahead with AI, which is so huge an energy hog it’s prompted a number of tech companies to abandon their climate goals. Schmidt then threw out the farfetched notion that we should go all in on AI because maybe AI will somehow, maybe, eventually know how to “solve” climate, saying: “I’d rather bet on AI solving the problem than constraining it.” Eventually is not good enough. A distinguished group of scientists said in a paper published on 8 October: “We are on the brink of an irreversible climate disaster. This is a global emergency beyond any doubt. Much of the very fabric of life on Earth is imperiled. We are stepping into a critical and unpredictable new phase of the climate crisis.” We need to pull back from that brink, but Schmidt is arguing for plunging over it, because guys like him are excited about AI. This is like arguing we should jettison the lifeboats and hang out on the sinking ship because what if there was eventually a totally awesome, new kind of lifeboat we can’t even imagine right now? We have the lifeboats now – we have the solutions, and we have had them for a while, and they keep getting better, as in better-designed, more efficient, more affordable and adaptable. We just need to implement them, but they’re just not the solutions a lot of the rich and powerful like. Proposing we go for some false or nonexistent solution has become an excuse constantly deployed as an excuse for not supporting the solutions we have. “Delay is the new denial” became a slogan in the climate movement a few years ago, and maybe “decoy is the new denial” should be added to it, by which I mean proposing we ignore workable present-day solutions in favor of unworkable and nonexistent ones while continuing to burn fossil fuel. One might think that Schmidt, whose net worth is estimated at around $23bn, would devote some time and resources to organizing us to reach our climate goals rather than excuse himself from acting with his dismissive defeatism. But overall billionaires and the very rich are part of the problem, with their outsized power and the dismal ways most of them use it. And their climate impact is obscene – the richest 1% of humanity is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest 66%. Scientists and engineers have been telling us for a very long time what we need to do and how to do it, and most of us already know that what we need to do is make a swift transition away from burning fossil fuels. Protecting forests and other natural systems and redesigning how we live, travel and produce and consume also matter, but phasing out the extraction and burning of fossil fuels is the big one. Schmidt lives in California, where we’ve been getting more than 100% of our electricity needs met many days this year by sun, wind and water, and storing the surplus in immense battery systems. Obviously not everything in California runs on electricity, but this is a nice demonstration model of how rapidly a renewable system can scale up. When it comes to some of the tech oligarchs, I suspect the sheer modesty of the solutions – that we should consume less, which means we can produce less, and make this energy transition to a renewable-powered world – is not the kind of gee-whiz rocket science they love. (Though solar and wind technologies are pretty amazing, particularly if you know how rapidly their design has improved, their cost has plummeted and their implementation has spread.) It is in many ways a social solution in which lots of us adjust how we live and how we power our devices, not a grand centralized invention that is super profitable for a few. I do not know if it would be worse to live in a world in which we genuinely did not have the solutions, or to live in one where we have them but are not implementing them on the speed and scale we know we need to.

This is carbon capture and storage (CCS), a process that recently received a major boost in the UK when the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, announced a £22bn investment in CCS schemes that would eventually lead to 8.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year being removed from emissions from British industrial plants. It should be noted that the UK emitted 384m tonnes of carbon dioxide last year, so the scheme will clearly make little difference to our overall contribution to global warming. However, it should, if successful, highlight a route for tackling the crisis by providing us with an additional weapon in the fight against global warming alongside renewable energy, electric cars and home insulation. From that perspective, Miliband deserves congratulation – though questions remain. Why should public money be spent on cleaning up emissions created by the fossil fuels that make private companies so much money, for example? Crucially, we are failing to halt global warming.

The government’s plan for carbon capture and storage (CCS) – catching carbon dioxide from major industry and pumping it into rocks under the North Sea – is a fossil fuel-driven boondoggle that will accelerate climate breakdown. Its ticket price of £21.7bn is just the beginning of a phenomenal fiscal nightmare. There might be a case for a CCS programme if the following conditions were met. First, that the money for cheaper and more effective projects had already been committed. The opposite has happened. Labour slashed its green prosperity plan from £28bn a year to £15bn, and with it a sensible and rational programme for insulating 19m homes. The government boasts that its CCS scheme will be “the equivalent of taking around 4m cars off the road”. But at far lower cost, through a rational transport policy, it could remove millions of real cars from the roads, while improving our mobility, cutting air pollution and releasing land for green spaces and housing. It could also launch a programme for the mass restoration of nature in the UK. The rewilding of land and sea would draw down vast amounts of carbon from the atmosphere while simultaneously reversing our ecological catastrophe. All these are cost-effective ways of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. And all of them, unlike CCS, have “co-benefits”: they achieve more than one good thing. That £21.7bn is the budget for construction only. To judge by decades of expensive CCS failures, it’s likely to be highly optimistic. The UK’s three previous attempts at CCS (the 2005 Peterhead plan, the 2011 demonstration project and the 2012 funding competition) were all cancelled as a result of cost escalation. An analysis by Oxford University’s Smith School shows that a heavy reliance on CCS massively increases the costs of cutting emissions. By contrast to other technologies such as solar, wind and batteries, its costs have not fallen at all in 40 years. When I asked the government what guarantee it could provide that construction costs would be capped at £21.7bn, it gave me a woolly answer about “value for money”, but no such reassurance. And this is just the start of it. Buried in an obscure ancillary document is a government commitment to pay a “premium” for the hydrogen component of the CCS programme for 15 years. How much will the total cost of this be? Again, no clear answer. Cutting cost-effective measures in favour of an open-ended, staggeringly expensive programme is the very definition of fiscal irresponsibility. The second condition is that CCS will accelerate or complete the UK’s decarbonisation. But there’s a reason why oil and gas companies have lobbied so forcefully for this policy: it licenses continued fossil fuel production. The government’s CCS decision has been sold to us as a way to deliver blue hydrogen. This means hydrogen made from fossil gas, as opposed to green hydrogen, which is made by electrolysis with renewable electricity. An analysis by the climate experts Carbon Tracker shows that the additional gas demand caused by the UK’s CCS blue hydrogen programme will greatly increase overall emissions. It would exhaust the UK’s domestic gas supply, which would then necessitate importing liquefied gas (LNG) from the US and other sources. The government knows this, which is why it intends to approve the construction of an LNG terminal at Teesside. LNG from the US, thanks to the impacts of fracking, liquefaction and leakage, releases higher greenhouse gas emissions than coal. Blue hydrogen produced from LNG massively exceeds the low carbon hydrogen standard with which the entire programme is justified. Far from accelerating decarbonisation, Labour’s CCS scheme locks in high emissions and fossil fuel dependency for decades to come. Don’t take it from me. Take it from the government. There’s a rule applied to all such spending, called “principle H”. It says: “subsidies for the decarbonisation of emissions linked to industrial activities in the UK shall achieve an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.” Uniquely, the government has decided that principle H is “not applicable” to its CCS programme. Otherwise, it notes, the scheme could not proceed, because “liquified natural gas is associated with increased upstream emissions of greenhouse gases”. The breathtaking excuse it gives for rescinding this principle is that the state will “subsidise the construction” of CCS plants but “not their operation”. This is untrue and nonsensical. Labour ministers are spending £21.7bn on an alleged climate project that will increase emissions, and they know it. The third condition is an audit of the carbon emissions that cannot be eliminated by other means. The government tells me there are “no viable alternatives” to CCS for “decarbonising key industrial sectors (eg cement)”. But what if there are? What if conventional cement production were replaced with geopolymeric cement? What if green hydrogen were used to make steel? What if thermal power plants were no longer required for electricity production? No such audit has been conducted. Already, as Carbon Tracker has shown, the assumptions behind the CCS programme are outdated. The decision to deploy CCS comes before an attempt to determine whether it is necessary. That’s what happens when fossil fuel lobbyists drive government policy. When I asked the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero for background documents, all those it sent me were published by the previous government. None had been updated since Labour took office. This, in other words, is Tory policy. My guess is that Labour feared that dropping the Tory programme, with its massive handouts to corporations, would trigger a concerted attack by lobby groups and the billionaire press, alleging it was “anti-business”. Our money is being used for political purposes. Starmer campaigned on a platform of “change”. But there has been no change from this demented Tory policy, no change in the influence of the fossil fuel industry, no change in the perverse justifications. And, I suspect, there will be no change from £50bn for this profligate CCS scheme. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, talks of a fiscal “black hole” of £21.9bn. But this is a real black hole: a long tunnel into the rocks, down which £21.7bn and more will be poured. A more reliable and cost-effective means of sequestering carbon would be to bundle up the money (roughly 1,100 tonnes in £20 notes) and shove it down the pipe.

For politicians, the problem with clarity is that it demands action. Complexity provides safety because action can more easily be avoided. And so the obvious and clear are painted as “extreme”, while the complex is regarded as “mature”. For example, rather than reduce emissions or prevent commercial activity and expansion in areas where native species are under threat, the government has hosted a “Global Nature Positive Summit”. Apparently helping to “build consensus on the economic settings needed to increase investment in nature” is better than doing what scientists say is needed. It might seem obvious that companies will not solve the climate crisis nor save threatened species, but instead we get wrapped in the mature and complex world where “corporate leaders will explore the pivotal role businesses play in achieving our national and global biodiversity goals and highlight ways to embed nature into corporate strategy”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Let’s hope they embed that strategy before the Maugean skate is extinct. Complexity hides things. But Australia’s emissions reductions are actually not complex. Almost all the reduction in emissions since 2005 has come from not clearing as much land as we did in 2005 (the “land use” category of emissions). Conversely, all the reductions to be madefrom now into the future (or at least until 2030) will need to come from reducing actual emissions. If the graph does not display, click here When the Albanese government was elected, there were 92 months to go till 2030; now there are 63. To state the obvious, a third of those 92 months are used up, and Australia’s emissions have not fallen at all. It seems pretty clear that offsetting increased emissions will not actually reduce emissions. And yet that is the policy the government is committed to. Similarly, we are told the housing affordability crisis is complex. The solution is multifaceted and might even require introducing tax incentives to get older couples to rent out their spare rooms. Or perhaps, as the Queensland government has shown, the solution is rather more obvious and involves buying up vacant properties and using them for low-cost housing. Governments obviously also need to build new homes: If the graph does not display, click here I am often told that it is too simplistic to point to the fact the 25-year decline in housing affordability occurred after fewer public-sector homes were built and the tax system was changed to incentivise speculation and tax avoidance. Saying it’s more complex avoids stopping what hasn’t worked (and which has made things worse). The cost-of-living crisis is also, we are told, a very complex thing. As an economist I could write about the interaction of demand and supply pressures to ensure you stopped reading because it is all too much to understand. But we saw last month that companies such as Woolworths and Coles have massive pricing power – the prices they set have little to do with costs and more to do with profit. They set the prices – you don’t go in and haggle over the price of a packet of chips. Regardless of potential breaches of law, those companies have obviously abrogated their social licence and need greater oversight by a body that can actually demand explanations for why they have coincidentally decided to take it in turns having Coke on special every other week. Also, rather obviously, the main reason for the cost-of-living crisis is that wages have grown much slower than prices. Back in March 2020, the average annual full-time wage was about $90,000.

After the past three years, we know that is just an argument by business groups to not have to pay workers more. It’s the same thing we see with calls to abolish the junior award rates. Everywhere in society someone aged 18 is treated as an adult, except when they get paid.

That’s because there’s no way to keep it from getting worse without joint public action: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us we have five years left to cut emissions in half, which means it will not be accomplished one Tesla at a time; it requires aggressive public action of the kind the current White House is coordinating, as it sets up battery factories and shepherds new transmission lines through various regulatory fences. But there’s also no way to survive it, even in its current form, without intense cooperation. To give one example: Florida’s insurance system is clearly breaking down, as one storm after another drives private insurers out of the state. As the Tampa newspaper put it in June: “As the crisis escalates, state leaders are desperately trying to convince insurance companies to stick around. States are offering them more flexibility to raise premiums or drop certain homes from coverage, fast-tracking rate revisions and making it harder for residents to sue their insurance company.” But as that seawall begins to fail, “a flood of new policyholders are joining state-backed insurance ‘plans of last resort’, leaving states to assume more of the risk on behalf of residents who can’t find coverage in the private sector.” Indeed, so many people are swamping the “state-backed insurance plans” they’re becoming overloaded with risk. Ten months ago, the Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse and his budget committee colleagues wrote to the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, to ask for proof that Florida’s public Citizens Insurance could survive disasters like the one now bearing down on Tampa. DeSantis may have given his most eloquent response in May, when he signed a bill essentially outlawing the phrase “climate change” in Florida statutes. “I’m not a global warming person,” he explained. Meanwhile, across the upland terrain drenched by Helene, rightwing forces have been relentlessly spreading rumors: most prominently, that the Federal Emergency Management Administration (Fema) spent all its money on migrants and has none left for Americans. This is not true. (Indeed, its closest approach to truth came during the Trump years when Fema did divert relief funds to “tighten the border”.) But it’s one more way to divide people, to use their very real trauma for political gain. The dystopian future is not just about the endless fires and floods; it’s also about a society that pulls apart in their face, where people can’t work together because they’ve been so divided by disinformation and hate.

Climate chaos is changing all that, breaking the patterns, delivering water in torrents unprecedented in recorded history or withholding it to create epic droughts, while heat-and-drought-parched soil, grasslands and forests create ideal conditions for mega-wildfires. Water in the right time and quantity is a blessing; in the wrong ones it’s a scourge and a destroying force, as we’ve seen recently with floods around the world. In the vice-presidential debate, Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, noted that his state’s farmers “know climate change is real. They’ve seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods, back to back.” Farmers around the world are dealing with flood, drought and unseasonable weather that impacts their ability to produce food and protect soil. The rainfall from Hurricane Helene turned into a torrent on the Nolichucky River in east Tennessee that at its height was almost twice the normal flow of Niagara Falls. The water in that river and others overtopped dams and triggered fears that they might break. In western North Carolina, the French Broad River, which runs through Asheville, crested at an unprecedented level, thanks to dozens of inches of rain in the surrounding mountains draining fast into its tributaries. Water became a violent force tearing apart buildings, streets and neighborhoods, and drowning humans and animals, while winds toppled trees across the region, the grip of their roots weakened by the rain-saturated soil. Roads, bridges, transmission lines and crucial infrastructure were swept away or smashed. Scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimate that “climate change may have caused as much as 50% more rainfall during Hurricane Helene in some parts of Georgia and the Carolinas. Furthermore, we estimate that the observed rainfall was made up to 20 times more likely in these areas because of global warming.” The sheer amount of water Helene dumped across its 500-mile path is staggering: 40tn gallons, one scientist calculated, the equivalent of pouring the entire contents of Lake Tahoe over the region, enough water to cover the entire state of North Carolina in water 3.5ft deep. “Water is life” became a key slogan at the Dakota Access pipeline protests in 2016, but it can also be a deadly force. One of the ironies of the current situation in Asheville, North Carolina, and other hurricane-and-flood-impacted towns is that water is everywhere – muddy, contaminated water – but with broken water mains, power outages and contaminated sources, water to drink and wash with is scarce. There have been deluges in the region before, but this was a climate disaster. Around the world, catastrophic flooding is wrecking whole regions – perhaps the worst of all were the 2022 floods that covered a third of Pakistan, but the April-May floods in southern Brazil were a catastrophe that “displaced more than 80,000 people, led to over 150,000 being injured and, on the 29th of May, to 169 fatalities with 44 people still missing” as of June. Repeated floods in New England and the Houston region are among the US’s climate disasters, while the UK and continental Europe, Japan and several African nations, including Mozambique and Kenya this year, have been hit hard by flooding. Only last month, according to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, “In Chad, where an estimated 1.5 million people have been affected, initial assessments point to the destruction of over 164,000 homes, with all 23 provinces of the country involved, and Tandjile, Mayo-Kebbi Est, Logone and Lac among the most afflicted provinces. Over 259,000 hectares of croplands have been wiped out, heightening the risk of food shortages in a country already grappling with chronic food insecurity.” Floods are not new, but the intensity and frequency of catastrophic flooding is. The climate crisis is a water crisis. We now live on a more violent planet than the one we left behind a few decades ago, the one we will look back on as peaceful, gentle, predictable. More violent, more unpredictable, more chaotic, more destructive, more dangerous. Some of that danger is heat itself, but water is proving to be a major part of climate crisis. The basic equation cited by climate scientists is that warmer air holds more water. “For every degree celsius that Earth’s atmospheric temperature rises, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can increase by about 7%, according to the laws of thermodynamics,” says Nasa. Which means more warming will create more rainfall – but the climate crisis also shifts wind and ocean currents, making how and where that rainfall arrives unpredictable. The old terminology of “hundred-” and “thousand-year” events no longer makes sense, now that they are happening so often. Behind the violence of climate-driven extreme weather is the violence of the fossil fuel industry, whose scientists clearly recognized climate change’s coming impact and whose leaders decided to go for it. Their signature is on these storms, on the smashed homes and smashed lives, the miles of mud, the pools of filthy water, the broken power stations and broken forests.

298,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2024/oct/03/tanya-plibersek-coalmine-decision-climate-housing-emissions,2024-11-03,GrogonomicsPlibersek’s coalmine decision is double trouble for climate and housing,"The emissions impact is obvious but with full employment in construction, approving three mine extensions is saying you want workers there rather than building homes When the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, approved three new coalmine expansions last week, she not only failed abjectly to act on climate change, but by diverting scarce workers from constructing homes to expanding fossil-fuel projects, she also made it harder for the government to improve housing affordability through its aim of building 1.2m new homes in five years. Last week Plibersek posted photos of her releasing a cute little bilby into a wild training zone. Oddly there was no such cute photo, nor mention on her list of “some of the things I’m most proud of”, of her approving those three coalmine expansions, which will generate about 1.3bn tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime. On ABC’s Weekend Breakfast, when asked how the approval squared with both the government’s commitment to net zero by 2050 and the pleas from those living in the Pacific Islands to reduce our emissions, she batted away the questions. Apparently, approving 1.3bn tonnes of emissions does not undermine the government’s commitments to reaching net zero, the minister argued, because “all of these projects fit within our safeguard mechanism”. At this point it is worth noting the “safeguard mechanism” was first developed by Tony Abbott and if red flags aren’t waving at this point then you might want to Google “Tony Abbott climate change is crap”. The safeguard mechanism allows companies to pay their way out of reducing emissions by buying carbon offsets. These offsets are often utterly worthless, and cost relatively so little that these mining companies had no qualms about paying the cost to emit 1.3bn tonnes of CO2. Maybe I am too simple, but if your emissions reduction policy does not actually deter coal companies from increasing their emissions, I think there may be an issue with how it works. Ending thermal coalmining is the lowest-hanging fruit in reducing emissions, and yet the government is unwilling to pick it. But at least the safeguard mechanism allows government ministers such as Chris Bowen to say that “Australia is already on track to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030”. I’m not sure what track the minister is looking at, but the government’s own figures suggest otherwise. If the graph does not display, click here Minister Plibersek might think Pacific Islanders should stop worrying about the government approving new coalmines but, unfortunately, they are not so gullible. Dr Maina Talia, the Tuvalu climate minister, called the decision “a direct threat to our collective future”. Maybe Tuvalu should just try to offset their future. Clearly, approving more coalmines is not good for the climate, but what is less understood is how it is also bad for the economy – especially if you want to build (as the government does) 1.2m homes in five years. The problem is one of crowding out. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Usually when economists talk of “crowding out”, they mean the government using up the resources in the economy and making it hard for the private sector to get workers or investment. But it also works the other way. Construction workers – especially those in the “technician and trades” occupation group – are in very short supply. The unemployment rate for workers in the construction industry has been below 3% for most of the past three years, and there are now fewer than two unemployed construction workers per job vacancy. If the graph does not display, click here It is easier to get work in construction now than during the mining boom. That means there is a big fight for workers. Crucially, mining construction competes for the same workers as those building houses, apartments and public infrastructure such as roads and rail. Approving a coalmine means that work will “crowd out” other types of construction work. You want to build 1.2m homes? Great, but who will build them?

299,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2024/oct/03/tanya-plibersek-coalmine-decision-climate-housing-emissions,2024-11-03,Plibersek’s coalmine decision is double trouble for climate and housing,"The emissions impact is obvious but with full employment in construction, approving three mine extensions is saying you want workers there rather than building homes When the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, approved three new coalmine expansions last week, she not only failed abjectly to act on climate change, but by diverting scarce workers from constructing homes to expanding fossil-fuel projects, she also made it harder for the government to improve housing affordability through its aim of building 1.2m new homes in five years. Last week Plibersek posted photos of her releasing a cute little bilby into a wild training zone. Oddly there was no such cute photo, nor mention on her list of “some of the things I’m most proud of”, of her approving those three coalmine expansions, which will generate about 1.3bn tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime. On ABC’s Weekend Breakfast, when asked how the approval squared with both the government’s commitment to net zero by 2050 and the pleas from those living in the Pacific Islands to reduce our emissions, she batted away the questions. Apparently, approving 1.3bn tonnes of emissions does not undermine the government’s commitments to reaching net zero, the minister argued, because “all of these projects fit within our safeguard mechanism”. At this point it is worth noting the “safeguard mechanism” was first developed by Tony Abbott and if red flags aren’t waving at this point then you might want to Google “Tony Abbott climate change is crap”. The safeguard mechanism allows companies to pay their way out of reducing emissions by buying carbon offsets. These offsets are often utterly worthless, and cost relatively so little that these mining companies had no qualms about paying the cost to emit 1.3bn tonnes of CO2. Maybe I am too simple, but if your emissions reduction policy does not actually deter coal companies from increasing their emissions, I think there may be an issue with how it works. Ending thermal coalmining is the lowest-hanging fruit in reducing emissions, and yet the government is unwilling to pick it. But at least the safeguard mechanism allows government ministers such as Chris Bowen to say that “Australia is already on track to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030”. I’m not sure what track the minister is looking at, but the government’s own figures suggest otherwise. If the graph does not display, click here Minister Plibersek might think Pacific Islanders should stop worrying about the government approving new coalmines but, unfortunately, they are not so gullible. Dr Maina Talia, the Tuvalu climate minister, called the decision “a direct threat to our collective future”. Maybe Tuvalu should just try to offset their future. Clearly, approving more coalmines is not good for the climate, but what is less understood is how it is also bad for the economy – especially if you want to build (as the government does) 1.2m homes in five years. The problem is one of crowding out. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Usually when economists talk of “crowding out”, they mean the government using up the resources in the economy and making it hard for the private sector to get workers or investment. But it also works the other way. Construction workers – especially those in the “technician and trades” occupation group – are in very short supply. The unemployment rate for workers in the construction industry has been below 3% for most of the past three years, and there are now fewer than two unemployed construction workers per job vacancy. If the graph does not display, click here It is easier to get work in construction now than during the mining boom. That means there is a big fight for workers. Crucially, mining construction competes for the same workers as those building houses, apartments and public infrastructure such as roads and rail. Approving a coalmine means that work will “crowd out” other types of construction work. You want to build 1.2m homes? Great, but who will build them? It won’t be those who are constructing a coalmine expansion, or some new gasfield. In a period of full employment in the construction industry, approving new coalmines is essentially saying you want workers to go do that rather than build homes.

The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran’s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran’s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman’s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an “independent and impartial” investigation into the allegations of abuse. “Iran’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,” it said on social media. “Pending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.” Iran’s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn “inappropriate clothes” and had “stripped” after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited “witnesses”, it said that security guards had spoken “calmly” with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities.

It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. The Republican nominee will kick off this morning with a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, followed by an afternoon event in Kinston, North Carolina, and rounding the day off in Macon, Georgia. Harris, meanwhile, will head to Michigan later today where the Democratic hopeful is due to speak at a campaign rally at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Last night, she broke from the campaign trail to embrace her reputation as a “joyful warrior” with a surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live. Harris portrayed herself, appearing in a mirror opposite the actor Maya Rudolph, who first played her on the show in 2019 and has reprised the role this season. If you missed it, you can read David Smith’s fun report here: In other developments: A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water. A US government communications regulator has claimed that Vice-President Kamala Harris’s surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live violates “equal time” rules that govern political programming. Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. Here’s more on the claim by the FCC regulator: Senator Raphael Warnock condemned Donald Trump after saying that, whether women like it or not, he will “protect women”. Warnock told NBC News that the comment ‘sounds rather ominous coming from the mouth of a convicted sexual predator. We don’t need a predator, we need a president in the Oval Office, and that person is clearly Kamala Harris.’ Donald Trump started delivering his remarks in Kinston, North Carolina, about two hours behind schedule. So far, he’s accused his opponent Kamala Harris of doing “the worst job ever on hurricane salvage and removal” and attacked Senate GOP minority leader Mitch McConnell. “Hopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,” Trump said. “Can you believe he endorsed me? Boy, that must’ve been a painful day in his life.” Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said he expects the winner of the presidential election to be declared on election day. In an interview with ABC News, the former president was asked whether he thought there was any way he could lose. “Yeah, I guess, you know,” Trump said. “I guess you could lose, can lose. I mean, that happens, right? But I think I have a pretty substantial lead … Bad things could happen. You know, things happen, but it’s going to be interesting.” He also told the outlet’s chief Washington correspondent, Jonathan Karl, that he has “a substantial lead” in the presidential race. Kamala Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. “I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it’s the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,” Harris told reporters. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. Harris dodges if she voted for CA’s prop 36–a measure to up crime/drug penalties. ""I am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election and I don’t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other” pic.twitter.com/00AHqRIt0K Donald Trump told supporters that he should have stayed in the White House, despite his losing the 2020 election, while at Lititz in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president’s remarks were made during one of his final rallies of the campaign, where he also denounced public polls putting him behind his rival Kamala Harris and joked that reporters could take a bullet for him. The comments were off script – an acknowledgment of how he has become increasingly uninhibited as the fatigue of doing multiple rallies a day has inexorably taken its toll. Trump stayed on message for some of his remarks, saying illegal immigration was down and the economy was up when he was president. His team has noted with satisfaction for weeks that they remain the top two issues for undecided voters across the battleground states. But Trump could not resist reverting to his most problematic impulses of describing Democrats as “demonic” and then lamenting about the 2020 election, an issue that polls poorly and his team had thought they had convinced him to let it go. “We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” Trump said. “I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – ” and then abruptly cut himself off. The remark reflected what Trump told aides and allies in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, a loss he has never conceded, and how he sat in at least one meeting at the end of his first term where he mused about refusing to leave the White House, a person familiar with the matter said. Once Trump started on the 2020 election, he could not stop. He revived debunked conspiracy theories from 2020 and suggested anew that voting machines would be hacked, and efforts to extend polling hours in Pennsylvania – what his own team has pushed for – amounted to fraud. Trump also spent time at the rally lashing out at a series of recent polls, notably a Des Moines Register poll in Iowa that put him four points behind Harris in the state of Iowa. Harris is universally not expected to win Iowa, but it could be indicative of her momentum in the final days. Here’s more context on the rally: The Harris campaign condemned former president Donald Trump’s comments at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier today, where he accused Democrats of stealing the elections from President Joe Biden and expressed it “should be illegal” to release polls that are bad for him. “Trump is spending the closing days of his campaign angry and unhinged, lying about the election being stolen because he’s worried he will lose,” said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign. “The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth and will walk into the Oval Office focused on them – that’s Vice President Harris,” she added. Donald Trump said Robert F Kennedy Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected “sounds OK to me”. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump told NBC News. “You know, it’s possible.” Trump was asked whether banning certain vaccines would be an option during a second term, and he said he would talk to Kennedy and others before making a decision. “But he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump said of the former independent presidential candidate. Kamala Harris stopped by Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles in Michigan on Sunday, joined by the state’s governor Gretchen Whitmer and the mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan.

Meanwhile, performances by 2 Chainz, Anthony Hamilton, Ciara, and Joy of Jesse & Joy, with remarks by Usher, will take place in Atlanta, Georgia. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that Trump’s comments about a potential assassin having to “shoot through” the press to get to him at a rally today had “nothing to do with the Media being harmed”. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life,” said Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign communications director. “President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also,” Cheung said. During a rally in Pennsylvania earlier, Trump said: I have this glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much. He did not mention that the media should also have protective glass. The Harris-Walz campaign announced a slew of election day Eve events, including rallies in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. In Arizona, Harris-Walz supporters will rally in Phoenix with a performance by the band La Original Banda El Limón. On Monday, the campaign will also hold an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day slated to perform. In Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, and The War and Treaty will take the stage in support of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Eva Longoria is scheduled to make remarks at an event with performances by Christina Aguilera, Los Tigres Del Norte and SOFI TUKKER. Kamala Harris delivered remarks at the Greater Emmanuel Institutional church of God in Christ in Detroit, Michigan. Harris is making several stops in Michigan and is slated to hold a rally in East Lansing later today. “So church, in just two days we have the power to decide the fate of our nation, for generations to come,” Harris said at Sunday’s service. Harris said that God’s plan is to “heal us and bring us together as nation”, but that it is not enough to believe in those plans, we “must act”. “Not enough to only pray, not enough to just talk, we must act on the plans he has in store for us. And we must make them real through our works, in our daily choices, in service to our communities and yes, in our democracy,” the Democratic nominee said.

Later today, Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Kinston, North Carolina, at 2pm ET. Four-and-a-half hours later, he’s scheduled to deliver remarks in Macon, Georgia. More than 100 former US senators, members of Congress, governors, top-ranking military veterans, and White House officials released a bipartisan statement emphasizing the importance of American trust in elections and the peaceful transfer of power. “Election workers must be supported, not threatened. Upholding public confidence in how elections work and in the members of our communities across the country who are working tirelessly to administer safe and secure elections strengthens us as a nation,” they wrote. Some of the signatories include former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, former defense secretary Leon Panetta, former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, and retired Gen Stanley McChrystal. Donald Trump invited David McCormick, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania for the US Senate, to the stage. McCormick took a stab at his opponent Bob Casey, calling him a candidate “born with a silver political spoon in his mouth”. Polls show the Democratic incumbent ahead in the race. Former president Donald Trump told a crowd in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn’t mind if a shooter were to “shoot through” the press. “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump said. He also called the press “seriously corrupt people”.","['Trump', 'Michigan State University', 'Trump', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'FCC', 'NBC News', 'the Oval Office', 'Senate', 'GOP', 'ABC News', 'California’s Proposition', 'CA', 'the White House', 'Des Moines Register', 'the Oval Office', 'NBC News', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Kuzzo’s Chicken & Waffles', 'Sugarland', 'Joy of Jesse & Joy', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Trump', 'Media', 'Cheung', 'Trump', 'Harris-Walz', 'La Original', 'D-Nice', 'the Detroit Youth Choir', 'Christina Aguilera', 'Los Tigres', 'the Greater Emmanuel Institutional', 'Congress', 'White House', 'Senate', 'the US Senate']",politics,0.986,3.1672,False

An Israeli court announced the arrests on Friday afternoon, before the beginning of Shabbat, saying that a joint investigation by the police, internal security services and the army suspected a “breach of national security caused by the unlawful provision of classified information”, which had also “harmed the achievement of Israel’s war aims”. One of those arrested is believed to be spokesperson for the prime minister. While most details are still subject to a partial gag order, Israeli media has reported that the war aim in question is the release of the 101 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. The suspects are alleged to have selectively leaked Hamas strategy documents found by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza, and manipulated or edited the material to make it seem as though the Palestinian militant group sought to smuggle hostages to Egypt, and then to Iran or Yemen. In September, Netanyahu made this claim in interviews and news conferences in support of a fresh demand he had made in ceasefire and hostage release deal talks: the need for Israeli troops to remain on the Gaza-Egypt border. The demand was rejected by Hamas on the grounds it was not part of the terms both sides had already conditionally accepted, and was a major reason that months of negotiations failed. Netanyahu has been accused repeatedly of stalling on a deal in order to avoid the collapse of his coalition government. Anything short of a total victory over Hamas is anathema to his far-right allies, and he is believed to see staying in office as the best way of avoiding prosecution in fraud, bribery and breach of trust cases filed in 2019. He denies any wrongdoing. Shortly after the Israeli leader first mentioned the supposed Hamas plan, reports apparently based on the same doctored material appeared in the British outlet The Jewish Chronicle and the German tabloid Bild, which were picked up widely by the Israeli media. Worried that the articles’ publication would jeopardise intelligence-gathering efforts in Gaza, the Israeli army launched an investigation into the leak, announcing that it was “unaware of any such document existing”. The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister’s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister’s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: “We have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.”","['Court', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'the Israel Defense Forces', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'Hamas', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'The Jewish Chronicle', 'Yair Lapid']",politics,-0.995,3.1984625,False

The scenes playing out in Paiporta on Sunday laid bare the mounting sense of abandonment among the devastated areas and the lingering anger over why an alert urging residents not to leave home on Tuesday was sent after the flood waters began surging. Much of the fury appeared to be directed at the elected officials, as calls rang out for the resignation of Pedro Sánchez, the country’s prime minister, and Carlos Mazón, Valencia’s regional leader. Sánchez was swiftly evacuated as bodyguards used umbrellas to protect the group from the barrage of mud. “What were they expecting?” one furious local person asked the newspaper El País. “People are very angry. Pedro Sánchez should have been here on day one with a shovel.” The king insisted on continuing the visit, at one point meeting a man who wept on his shoulder. He was also confronted by a young man who told him that “you’ve abandoned us”, asking why residents had been left on their own to grapple with the aftermath of the deadly floods. “You’re four days too late,” he told the king. The man also challenged the king on why the civil protection service, which is overseen by the regional government, had sent the alert hours after the state-run weather agency had warned of deteriorating conditions. “They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,” he shouted at the monarch. “It’s a disgrace.” Hours after the visit, King Felipe appeared to address the incident. Speaking to officials in Valencia in a video posted online, he said: “One has to understand the anger and frustration of many people given all that they have gone through, as well as the difficulty in understanding how all the mechanisms work when it comes to the emergency operations.” Spain’s royal palace later said that the king’s plans to visit a second hard-hit town in the region had been postponed. The public rage came as the death toll from the floods climbed to 217. As the meteorological agency on Sunday again issued a red alert, forecasting further heavy rain in the area, mayors from the affected municipalities pleaded with officials to send help. “We’re very angry and we’re devastated,” said Guillermo Luján, the mayor of Aldaia. “We have a town in ruins. We need to start over and I’m begging for help. Please help us.” The town’s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain’s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luján said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luján bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region’s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. “Right now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,” Luján told the broadcaster RTVE. “We don’t know what we’re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we’ll see. It might be heartbreaking.” In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town’s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. “It’s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,” she told the news agency Europa Press. “Everything is very difficult.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedaví, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year’s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a “rollercoaster” for the 17,000 residents. “You see sadness, which is logical given that we’ve lost our town,” Amparo Fort told reporters. “But on the other hand, it’s heartening to see the response that we’ve had from everyone … there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.” Sánchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as “the worst flood our continent has seen so far this century”. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. “I’m aware that the response we’re mounting isn’t enough. I know that,” he said. “And I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can’t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.” Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.","['King Felipe', 'El País', 'the civil protection service', 'King Felipe', 'RTVE', 'Europa Press', 'Alfafar', 'solidarity', 'Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences', 'Chiva']",politics,-0.9943,3.1699877,False

Brendan Carr, a commissioner with the federal communications commission (FCC), claimed on the social platform X that Harris’s appearance on the show “is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule”. Carr made the claim in response to an Associated Press alert to Harris being on the show that night. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct – a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” said Carr, who was nominated by both Trump and Biden and confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times. FCC guidelines state: “Equal opportunities generally means providing comparable time and placement to opposing candidates; it does not require a station to provide opposing candidates with programs identical to the initiating candidate.” A spokesperson for the FCC issued a statement: “The FCC has not made any determination regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint from any interested parties.” Harris joined comedian Maya Rudolph at the start of the show in a sketch that skewered Donald Trump for his recent rally speeches, including wearing an orange and yellow safety jacket, a riff on the ongoing garbage controversy, and pretending to fellate a broken microphone. Harris began her “mirror image” sketch opposite Rudolph, the SNL cast member selected to impersonate her, on the other side of a mirror. “I’m just here to remind you, you got this, because you can do something your opponent can’t do – you can open doors,” Harris told Rudolph, seemingly referring to a video from earlier in the week in which Trump had struggled to reach the handle of a garbage truck he briefly rode in to a Wisconsin rally. That came after a comedian at a Trump rally in New York made a joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” that was widely deemed racist. Trump disavowed the comedian but did not apologize. On a video call to Latino voters, President Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage. The White House later denied he had and released a transcript with “supporters” altered to “supporter’s”, changing the meaning. White House stenographers appealed against the alteration. “The American people want to stop the chaos,” Rudolph said in the SNL sketch, with Harris adding, “And end the drama-la.” “With a cool new step mom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las. And watch a rom-com-ala,” Rudolph said, with the two later touting their “belief in the promise of America”. Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of SNL, which is celebrating its 50th season NBC, told the Hollywood Reporter in September that neither Harris or Trump would themselves appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels told the outlet. “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” In the interview, Michaels said Republicans were easier to characterize than Democrats who have been offended by certain skits. “It’s not personal in the sense of an attack, it’s just, you did say that and you did do that, so were you thinking it would be rude for us to comment on it? That’s what we do, and we’re going to do it again,” he said. The Trump campaign complained about Harris’s appearance, saying Harris “has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity”, spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. Some viewers also noted that Harris’s “mirror image” comedy sketch was conceptually identical to a sketch Trump featured in with ex-SNL comedian Jimmy Fallon on Fallon’s the Tonight Show in 2015. “I knew that SNL sketch with Kamala Harris looked familiar…” radio host Ari Hoffman said in an Instagram post linking to the Fallon-Trump skit.","['FCC', 'SNL', 'FCC', 'the federal communications commission', 'FCC', 'FCC’s Equal Time', 'Associated Press', 'Equal Time', 'Senate', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'SNL', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The White House', 'White House', 'SNL', 'SNL', 'NBC', 'Trump', 'Fox News Digital', 'SNL', 'Instagram']",politics,0.9214,3.17818,False

The new Conservative party leader also told the BBC that Boris Johnson had fallen into a “trap” of breaking lockdown rules that should never have been introduced. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England whose older brother Umar died of Covid while self-isolating, said Badenoch’s words could not gloss over the horrors of the pandemic. He said: “Ms Badenoch needs to remember that people were dying and being stored in industrial fridges while those in government partied in breach of the rules that they created for the rest of us. It was a question of trust and integrity and such a failure cannot ever be overblown.” Naomi Fulop, whose mother, Christina, died in January 2021, six days before one of the Downing Street parties that was found to have broken the rules, said Badenoch’s comments were “insulting and extremely painful”. She said: “It is not possible to overblow the impact of those in government partying while my mother died alone. We then had to have a very restricted funeral, as did thousands and thousands of other people.” Fulop, who is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group (CBFJUK), added: “I think she’s trying to appeal to people who don’t agree with lockdowns. She’s deeply misguided, because nobody is pro lockdown. Lockdowns are something that you have to have when everything else has failed.” Fulop also claimed Badenoch’s comments risked undermining public trust in any future government’s public health messages. “All the scientists say there will be another pandemic, it’s a question of when not if, so this absolutely undermines public trust in government and public health messaging, which is very concerning,” she said. Fulop added: “Badenoch said the Tory party needs to have an honest conversation about what’s gone wrong and one of the big things that went wrong was Partygate so I’m quite mystified that she doesn’t realise the impact that’s had on families like mine and the wider public.” Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died of Covid in April 2020, said: “It sounds as if she’s is trying to cover over the failures of her party which is horrifying and insulting. It shows a complete lack of empathy or self-awareness that does an incredible amount of damage to public trust.” Fowler, who is also a member of CBFJUK, said: “The fact that ministers were breaking safeguarding rules that were put in place specifically to protect people, while other people were obeying those rules and not being able to say goodbye to loved ones, was horrible. It was thumbing the nose at the general public.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said Badenoch’s remarks were “disgraceful”. He said: “Research has shown that Partygate and others scandals really did have an effect on public trust in government and particularly public trust in the rules. So as well as being offensive, it’s very unhelpful to try to retrospectively minimise the impact of Partygate.” He added: “There was a real sense that those who set the rules were flouting them or bending them and that really undermined the public message, so there are trickle on effects for saying this was all overblown.” Nathan Oswin, who leads the TUC’s work on the Covid public inquiry, said: “From what key workers and working people have told us, It’s hard to believe they judge it as ‘overblown’.
 “The Covid-19 public inquiry has heard time and again how much hurt the Partygate revelations caused to people across the country.

In October 2020, an Islamist terrorist tracked down and decapitated professor Samuel Paty as he left school on the last day before half-term holidays. In the days preceding his murder, Paty, 47, who taught geography and history, had been the subject of an intense campaign of online harassment sparked when a 13-year-old student claimed he had discriminated against his Muslim pupils during a class on moral and civic education. The girl told her father Paty had instructed Muslim students to leave the classroom at the Bois-d’Aulne secondary school at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the Paris suburbs while he showed students caricatures of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. In truth, the girl was not in Paty’s class that day and had made up the story to cover the fact she had been suspended from school for bad behaviour. Paty had used the images as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France and the question of “dilemmas”. He posed the question “to be or not to be Charlie?”, referring to the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag used to express support for the paper after a terrorist attack on its offices in January 2015 that killed 12 people. But Paty had not ordered any children to leave the room – instead he had told them they could turn away if they thought they would be offended by the images. The teenager could not have known that the story she told her father would spark a chain of events that would lead an 18-year-old Chechen, Abdoullakh Anzorov, to travel 100km (62 miles) from his home in Normandy to kill the teacher after her furious father posted the lie on social media. On Monday, the father, Brahim Chnina, will be one of eight adults – seven men and a woman – on trial in connection with the murder. Chnina is accused of association with a terrorist organisation after allegedly launching a social media campaign against Paty, including publishing videos online attacking Paty and designating him as a target by giving precise information about his identity and place of work. Prosecutors say Chnina was in contact with Anzorov nine times before the killing. He has denied the charge. Abdelhakim Sefrioui, founder of the pro-Hamas Sheikh Yassine collective in France, which was dissolved by the government after the murder, is accused of participating in the preparation of a video presenting “false and distorted information intended to arouse hatred” towards Paty. In the video, Sefrioui described Paty as a “thug”. During questioning, he told police he would never have posted the video had he imagined there was “one billionth of a chance” of provoking the teacher’s killing. Instead, he said he and Chnina were calling for disciplinary sanctions against Paty. His lawyers describe the charge against him as an “intellectual and judicial aberration”, arguing there is no proof of contact between him and Anzorov. Six others are charged with association with a criminal terrorist group and risk up to 30 years in jail if convicted. Two of Anzorov’s friends have been charged with complicity in Paty’s murder, the most serious charge carrying a 30-year prison sentence. Chnina’s daughter, whose story sparked the tragedy, and five other former students aged between 13 and 15 at the time of the killing, were tried last year. Chnina’s daughter received an 18-month suspended sentence for making “slanderous and false accusations”. The five other teenagers were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence. The girl, who had been suspended from school because of repeatedly failing to attend lessons, was reported to have told police she lied because she wanted to avoid disappointing her father. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behaviour,” Le Parisien reported. Chnina subsequently shared a video on Facebook in which he denounced Paty and called for him to be sacked from the secondary school. A second video posted on social media accused Paty of “discrimination”. Chnina complained to the school and the police, claiming Paty was guilty of “diffusing a pornographic image” and was “Islamophobic”. The issue snowballed on social media; 10 days later, Paty was dead. One of the convicted teenagers, had given Anzorov a description of Paty, pointed out the route he took on leaving the school and recruited other students to keep an eye out for the teacher. Anzorov, 18, a radicalised Islamist who had arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum, was shot dead by police after the incident. The town of Conflans-Saint-Honore is a civil party in the case. Laurent Brosse, the local mayor, said: “ For the vast majority of us, across all generations, the murder resonates as an attack on freedom, an attack on each and every one of us, on our society as a whole, on the values of our Republic, on our fundamental rights.” Brosse said: “Samuel Paty embodied the values of our Republic. Through his teaching, he sought to awaken the critical spirit of his pupils. He showed them the importance of debating ideas, mutual respect and tolerance.” The school will be named the Samuel Paty School from next year.","['Conflans-Sainte-Honorine', 'Normandy', 'Chnina', 'Anzorov nine', 'Anzorov’s', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'Le Parisien', 'Chnina', 'Chnina', 'the Samuel Paty School']",tech,-0.9997,3.1913033,False

The outline of the male genitalia – drawn by the on-foot journey of Terry Rosoman – stretches from Hay-on-Wye to Abergavenny via a double circuitous route taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny. It was completed in less than 24 hours by Rosoman, 38, a marketing director from south Wales, to raise money and awareness about men’s mental health issues for Movember. He said he chose to run the giant phallus to help gain the attention of his “target demographic”. He claimed most men find the shape “hilarious”. Rosoman began his journey with his friend Robin Hurst at 5pm on Friday at Abergavenny railway station and finished at about 4.30pm on Saturday at the same place. Speaking afterwards, Rosoman said: “It was really tough. The hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It was just a hard slog for 24 hours. “I didn’t sleep, I ran through the night, pitch black, I couldn’t see anything. We got lost loads of times.” The route involved climbing 2,820m in total. Rosoman said: “The elevation killed us. It was really tough. I’m just glad to get it done.” The Movember awareness charity campaign began 21 years ago as an annual sponsored moustache growing event, to raise awareness of men’s mental health, suicide prevention, prostate and testicular cancers. By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than £4,000 and is hoping to hit a target of £5,000. He said the most difficult part was running in “12 hours of pitch black” through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist.

Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads. – Robert Tait, 2 November Read more Loading... To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures. Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage.

The ­Dutchman’s ­uncompromising style and ­aggression has come under ­enormous scrutiny of late but with his victory from 17th on the grid at the São Paulo Grand Prix he gave a stark reminder that, for all that, he is an exceptional driver and in so doing left his title rival Lando ­Norris’s hopes shattered. This was a peerless performance, a masterclass in the rain in Brazil that has deservedly all but clinched Verstappen’s fourth title but a more unlikely win was hard to imagine before the lights went out. What had begun with such ­optimism that Norris could bring about a pivotal shift in the ­championship battle was reduced to nought after Verstappen’s ­remarkable victory, a swing then but one perhaps only the world champion himself might have imagined. It was achieved in a suitably dramatic and gripping contest as ­Verstappen came back amid the spray, running water and treacherous glassy surface, and ­Norris fell from pole to finish in sixth. The Dutchman can divide opinion, yet at his best he is thrilling to watch and at Interlagos he made the heart soar. Verstappen’s drive was admittedly favoured by a little good fortune, yet still mighty in the conditions in which a host of drivers crashed out and the race was stopped because of the intensity of the rain at one point. Even his superlative demonstration in 2016 in the wet at Interlagos, when he came back from 16th to finish third, was no match for this. While all around him errors were made, cars pirouetting hither and thither causing repeated safety car interruptions and including one crucial error by Norris on a restart, the world champion exhibited iron, flawless control to scythe through the field and take the lead and his first win since the Spanish GP in June. His sheer joy afterwards demonstrated what it meant when he took the flag in front of the Alpines of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly in second and third. Verstappen also clearly grasped the bigger picture. Three meetings remain, including one sprint race, but he has now extended his lead over Norris from 44 points to 62, with 86 still available. The task facing the British driver was already ­challenging and now appears to be a bridge too far. If Verstappen is 60 points ahead after the next round in Las Vegas his fourth title will be sealed. Worse still for Norris his finishing position remains to be confirmed. With the race opening in damp ­conditions Lance Stroll spun out on the formation lap and the start was aborted. Norris, however, then set off to complete another formation lap, was followed by the rest of the field and is under investigation for a start procedure infringement having not stayed in his slot as the rules require. The infringement, alongside a host of other drivers, is being investigated and penalties may yet be imposed. The day, rather like the season, was testing and emotional for Verstappen. He had been unlucky in qualifying, which had taken place on Sunday morning after being postponed on Saturday because of a heavy storm, caught out with the timing of a red flag. It left him in 12th place but starting from 17th with a five-place grid ­penalty after taking a new engine, while Norris claimed pole. Damage limitation had looked to be his best hope. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion From the off, however, he showed no indication the game was up and he hit it with all the shock and awe of November fireworks. A lightning start moved him up to 11th after only one lap and a swathe of ­precision ­overtakes followed. By lap 11 he was up to sixth and still within 10 ­seconds of the leader, George ­Russell, who had jumped Norris at the start. He was on a charge but some fortune favoured the Dutchman too. As heavy rain returned, McLaren and Mercedes pitted Norris and ­Russell under a virtual safety car while Verstappen stayed out. It proved inspired. The race was stopped shortly afterwards when the rain became untenable and Franco Colapinto crashed out. It was a huge moment for Verstappen, who could now take new tyres without pitting. The luck he would have felt he deserved after qualifying. He emerged in second behind the Alpine of Esteban Ocon with Norris now fourth. When racing resumed with Ocon leading, another safety car period was triggered and the restart on lap 43 was crucial. Verstappen, the bit firmly between his teeth and with magisterial and clinical finality, pounced on Ocon to take the lead through turn one, while in what could not have been a starker contrast, Norris slid off wide, the dampest of squibs, and dropped to seventh. Norris’s teammate Oscar Piastri was ordered to move over to allow him to take sixth but his hopes had gone. Verstappen then was in a different class in clean air, opening a huge gap and by the time he took the flag for an immense, breathtaking victory his lead was 20sec over Ocon and 30sec on Norris, the title now surely all but done. If he wraps it up on the Vegas strip, Brazil will surely be the moment that sticks with him from his hardest-fought title since 2021. Both Mercedes cars of Russell, who was fourth and Lewis Hamilton, who was 10th, are also under investigation for changing their tyre pressures while the wheels were on the car on the second grid and they too may receive a penalty. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson seventh and ninth for RB and Piastri in eighth.","['Lando \xadNorris’s', 'GP', 'the Alpines of Esteban Ocon', 'Lance Stroll', 'Norris', 'Mercedes', 'Franco Colapinto', 'Ocon', 'Ocon', 'Norris’s', 'Ocon', 'Mercedes', 'Ferrari', 'RB']",sport,0.9972,3.203045,False
